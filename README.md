# pentest-links: hacking tools, in context

This repository contains pointers to hacking resources in a bunch of useful formats that you can import to your environment (browser, distro, etc.) and then personalize as you please. Kind of an [Awesome List](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), but "importable" in an appropriate context so that the listed resources are actually available to you when you need them. Hopefully, this makes the list more useful and less overwhelming.

For example, [anqxe/awesome-pentest](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-pentest) lists some great Web-based information gathering tools (like Shodan and Censys). In this repository, the homepages for these tools are "listed" as entries in the [`firefox/bookmarks.json`](firefox/bookmarks.json) file, which is intended to be imported to a Mozilla Firefox (or derivative) browser, resulting in a Bookmarks Toolbar containing bookmarks to these resources.

Where a "compiled" version of a tool is not offered in this repository, it is instead listed in the context of its use in this README. (See below.)

This is a personal collection, though suggestions and contributions are heartily welcomed. :)
